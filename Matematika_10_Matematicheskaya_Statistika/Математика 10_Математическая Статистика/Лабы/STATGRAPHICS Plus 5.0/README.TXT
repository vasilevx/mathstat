------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Before You Start...

STATGRAPHICS Plus Version 5.0 will only run on a true 32-bit 
operating system -- Windows 95/98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000.

You must have at least 65 MB of space available on your 
hard drive to hold the program files, documentation, and sample
data files.  A minimum of 30 MB is required for a minimal install
of only the program files.

A minimum of 32 MB of RAM is required to run STATGRAPHICS Plus 
with "average" performance.  Complex calculations and graphs
will benefit from additional RAM. 

The Version 5.0 CD is composed of 24 installation files. It will 
create several subdirectories, including:

- Data, Manuals, and Test Data.

------------------------------------------------------------------

B) Installing the Software 
   
Version 5.0 of STATGRAPHICS Plus is available on CD. To install 
the software:

1. Insert the compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.  

2. On most systems, the setup program will start up automatically. 
   If it does not, in Windows Explorer, double click on SETUP.EXE 
   from the CD-ROM drive.

                            Or

   Click on START...RUN and type D:\SETUP.EXE in the text 
   box (where D: is the CD drive letter, substitute as necessary)

3. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

4. If you have purchased an international system, plug the sentinel 
   device into the parallel port on your computer.

5. If you have purchased an international system and are running 
   the Windows NT operating system, the first time STATGRAPHICS 
   Plus is launched, a window will display for installing the 
   Rainbow sentinel drivers.  Click on the Functions menu item, 
   then select "install sentinel drivers" from the list that 
   displays. You should then see an information dialog box that 
   says that the drivers have been successfully installed and that 
   you need to restart your computer.  Restart the Windows NT 
   operating system to complete the driver configuration.  

6. For Network installations, the STATGRAPHICS Plus registry 
   information must be accessible to each Windows operating system
   that runs STATGRAPHICS Plus.  If both Windows and STATGRAPHICS
   Plus reside on your server, the end-user must have read-write
   access to the server's Windows registry.  If Windows resides
   on the workstation, the STATGRAPHICS Plus registry information
   must be written to the Windows registry on the workstation.  The 
   CD Rom contains a program called serial.exe that you must run 
   on each client workstation to write the serial number to the 
   registry. Note: Serial.exe can be found on the CD-ROM.  Run this 
   executable from the client machine providing the installation 
   serial number.

7. When adding users to a Network installation, run AddUsers.exe on
   the server. Enter the total number of users in the dialog box
   displayed with the Password you were given when you purchased the
   additional licenses. AddUsers.exe may be found in the same 
   directory as the main sgwin.exe. 

8. If you enter an incorrect serial number while installing the 
   program, you do not have to reinstall the entire system. Instead, 
   copy the file serial.exe from the CD Rom to the directory 
   containing sgwin.exe. Then execute it and enter the correct 
   serial number.

You CANNOT run STATGRAPHICS Plus directly from the CD-ROM.


------------------------------------------------------------------

C) Manuals

If you have the Standard Edition, the only manual you need
is the printed STATGRAPHICS Plus Base System manual.
This manual can also be found online under the Help - Access
On-line Manuals menu item.

If you have Quality and Design, you will need the 
STATGRAPHICS Plus Base System manual and the
Quality and Design manuals which are available online under 
the Help menu item.

If you have the Professional version or an Enterprise Edition, 
you will need the STATGRAPHICS Plus Base System manual and
the Quality and Design, the Multivariate Methods, the Time-Series 
Analysis, and the Advanced Regression manuals which are available 
online.

------------------------------------------------------------------

D) Online Manuals

The electronic Version 5 Base System Manual, Quality and Design, 
Multivariate Methods, Time-Series Analysis, and Advanced Regression 
Manuals are accessible from within STATGRAPHICS under the Help menu 
item. The calculations, glossary, and references are also available. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

E) Preferences and Graphics Options

There is a Preferences dialog box under the Edit menu. This 
dialog box lets you set system defaults that will be used for all 
analyses in all sessions, unless changed.

Preferences for system options, graphics, link behavior and a 
directory for temporary files can be set in this dialog box.

Graphics options, including Profiles, are grouped on a tabbed
dialog box. To access Graphics Options, click the right mouse 
button on the graph you want to edit.

The default graphic profile for Version 5 is colored lines, 
points, and type on a white background. Profiles are also 
available for System (color, dark background) and System (black 
and white).

Use the Skip option on the Axis dialog box to remove axis labels.
Skipping produces a less cluttered appearance which allows for 
clearer display and printing. It is not the same as By which sets
the interval between tickmarks.
------------------------------------------------------------------

F) StatFolio

When combining StatFolios, you must have the first one open before
selecting Combine.

Closing a StatFolio will close the associated DataSheet, 
StatGallery, and StatReporter.
------------------------------------------------------------------

G) StatGallery

The maximum number of graphic panes allowed in the StatGallery
is one hundred with an unlimited number of text panes.  The 
StatGallery can cause problems when you are working at or 
attempting to go beyond this limit. You may experience a system 
crash if you have reached the limit and attempt to exceed the 
limit or cut/delete and paste at the limit level.

We recommend limiting the number of graphic panes to 95.

To copy a StatGallery pane to the StatReporter or other 
application, click the right mouse button from the StatGallery 
and select Copy from the pop-up menu. 

In order to use the Paste Special feature, select Picture
(Metafile) or Bitmap.  Do NOT select the SGWIN (StatFolios)
format.
------------------------------------------------------------------
 
H) StatReporter

The Copy Analysis to StatReporter allows you to copy all of the 
text and graphics panes from the active analysis to the 
StatReporter with one click of the mouse.

Use Copy and Paste or Paste Special to copy one pane at a time. 

In order to use the Paste Special feature, select Picture
(Metafile) or Bitmap.  Do NOT select the SGWIN (StatFolios)
format.
------------------------------------------------------------------

I) Print Drivers

Outdated or poorly programmed third-party video or printer 
drivers are sometimes responsible for printing and font 
problems. To isolate this possibility, reconfigure your 
system with the standard VGA driver supplied with Windows 
and then see if the problem recurs. You might also want to 
run the Control Panel and select a Microsoft-standard 
printer driver as your default printer.

To cooperatively help our combined user bases, several software 
manufacturers have constructed a printer driver database for 
users to access. This database includes compatible printer 
driver information which describes alternate drivers 
you can use in place of the one that you're using now, 
as well as which setup options you should modify to eliminate 
specific problems.

For more detailed information and a link to the database, please

------------------------------------------------------------------
J) Print Preview

If the Print Preview for the StatAdvisor or any other text pane
is unreadable on your system, it may be necessary to change the 
default font selection for the pane.

To change the font, maximize the StatAdvisor or text window, 
then from the main menu select Edit...Change Text Font.  
Courier type fonts are recommended.  You may want to experiment 
with the fonts available on your system to find the optimal for 
your system.
------------------------------------------------------------------

K) Quality and Design

The Version 5 Quality and Design manuals are available in 
electronic format. For more information on how to use this new 
format, please refer to Section D of this README file.

Excluded data points for MR(2) charts drop to the lower control 
line.

The worksheet spaces for DOE default to 128 lines for large
experiments. Use the pane options to modify the worksheet.
------------------------------------------------------------------

L) ODBC

We have refined our ODBC implementation in Version 5.
When you query a database, the Query Database
dialog box now includes a field for SCHEMA options for
users that work with shared databases.

When using ODBC to connect to Excel files, STATGRAPHICS
Plus assumes the first row is a variable name and does 
not bring in the numbers from the first row.  If you 
do not have variable names in the first row, put in 
a blank row to "import" your data properly.

------------------------------------------------------------------

M) Miscellaneous 

1. The StatWizard displays each time you start STATGRAPHICS Plus.
   To change this, de-select the "Show the StatWizard at Startup" 
   option at the bottom of the initial StatWizard dialog box.

2. The DataSheet is now maximized each time you start STATGRAPHICS
   Plus. The DataSheet must be minimized manually.  You cannot 
   change this default.  This default does not create memory 
   problems.

3. When combining StatFolios or DataSheets, you must have the 
   first one open before selecting Combine.

4. StatLink, by default, looks at the current DataSheet.

5. To de-select the Locate or Zoom feature, click on Select.

6. When using Locate from the right mouse button pop-up menu, 
   use the mouse for general positioning and then use the arrow 
   keys for fine-tuning. The arrow keys move the "locate" line 
   one pixel at a time.

7. The Radar Plot scaling is set from the initial data. If you 
   have a second plot with a different range of data, create a 
   new plot by using Plot...Exploratory Plots...Radar/Spider Plot.
   We do not recommend changing the variable by accessing the 
   input dialog box from the first plot.

8. The Data Editor in Version 5 of STATGRAPHICS Plus 
   has a capacity of 1024 columns by 999,999 rows.  In
   practice, the limitations on dataset size are determined
   by the resources available on your computer.  A minimal
   configuration (32 MB of RAM and limited virtual
   memory on the hard drive) will not permit you to load
   large datasets.
------------------------------------------------------------------

N) StatPublish

When publishing graphs, you have the option to select "Add 
interactivity to applets". If selected, users may identify points
on scatterplots by clicking on them. However, the graphs will look 
somewhat different than when originally created, and certain
features such as 3-D effects and certain text fonts will not
be supported. To insure that the graphs look identical to when
originally created, do not select this option.

O) StatFolio Start-up Scripts

To open a StatFolio from the Windows "Run" line, enter a statement
such as

	sgwin.exe "c:\data\My Statfolio.sgp"

You may also use the Windows "Document" list by double-clicking on 
the desired StatFolio.
